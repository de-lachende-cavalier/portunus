- [x] Prototype the thing to test feasibility
- [x] Build the core functionality
    - [x] Code up the locksmith
    - [x] Code up the librarian
- [x] Build the CLI interface
- [x] Make a function to handle tests in one line (be DRY)
- [x] Test, test, test (tests should be written as you write the code, but just make sure everything works well in this phase)
    - [x] Complete writing unit tests
    - [x] Write integration tests/test Cobra commands
- [x] Fix the monotonic clock reading problem (use .Round(0) when writing times to files, check the librarian_test.go)
- [ ] Look into using colored print for extra coolness (https://github.com/fatih/color)
- [ ] Refine, refine, refine (optimize the code both stylistically and functionally)
    - [ ] Look into splitting up librarian.go
    - [ ] Benches, maybe?
- [ ] Put the expiry data in a custom struct instead of using maps (maybe)
- [ ] Work on extra features (if any)
