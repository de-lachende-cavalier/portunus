- [x] Prototype the thing to test feasibility
- [ ] Build the core functionality
- [ ] Build the CLI interface
- [ ] Test, test, test (tests should be written as you write the code, but just make sure everything works well in this phase)
- [ ] Refine, refine, refine (optimize the code both stylistically and functionally)
- [ ] Work on portability (without this step the utility will only be usable on macOS systems)
- [ ] Work on extra features (if any)
